These are those strange little scripts that you wish someone else had written.  

A lot of it is built off of code I grabbed from various messageboards, and I try to give credit via links.  All of it is used in my work as a biologist and I'm just trying to share knowledge, not make money.  But, if you feel some bit of code isn't credited properly, please let me know and I'll rectify it or remove it.
