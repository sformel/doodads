//Macro for ImageJ

//We use this in the van ball lab to measure total leaf length in grass samples.

//This will sum the length of all lines selected in the  results window after being measured by the ROI manager.  

//Really written by someone named Kees here:
//http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/summing-columns-in-ROI-manager-td5005867.html

//To use, open imageJ.  Click Plugins > Macro > New
//Copy everything below here into the text editor and save it.  Then run it by selecting that macro: Plugins > Macros > Run.
